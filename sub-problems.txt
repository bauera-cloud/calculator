Sub-problems:


No error message when user tries to divide by 0

Disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the 
display ex: can’t be 12.2.3

The DELETE button also deletes the result

User is able to use an operator at the beginning or
end of the operation. Only the negative operator 
should work.

User is able to have multiple operators in the expression

First number isn’t able to be recognized as a negative 
number

There’s only a display for the result instead of result 
and expression

User can’t user previous result as apart of a new 
expression

Result always has a decimal. It should only display a 
decimal if a floating number was used in the expression



NOTES: 
    Be aware of all possible actions/operations user could 
    take
    work with the operation with the most constraints
    





















Subproblems I don't have to fix...

Expression can’t be more than two numbers - 12+12+12

Expression isn’t able to identify more than one operator 
in expression 12-12+12


EVENTUALLY...
I could make nthIndexOf for more than 1 operator.
